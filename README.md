# 🚧 Failure Ahead: Machine Learning-Based Predictive Maintenance System

A Machine Learning project that anticipates failures in industrial machines using real-time sensor data and IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ Problem Statement

Unplanned equipment failures in industrial environments lead to major downtimes and operational losses. The goal of this project is to **predict specific failure types** before they occur.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This system detects the following types of failures:
- Tool Wear
- Heat Dissipation Failure
- Power Failure
- Random Failures
- Overstrain Failure

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- IBM Watsonx.ai Studio (Cloud Lite)
- AutoAI Pipeline Generation
- Python + Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle Sensor Dataset
- ROC Curve Analysis

---

## 🧪 Algorithm & Deployment

- ✅ Best Model: Snap Random Forest Classifier  
- ✅ Accuracy: **99.5%**
- ✅ AutoAI Pipeline: Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Hyperparameter Tuning
- ✅ Deployment: IBM Watsonx.ai (P4 Deployment)
- ✅ Input: Manual entry or CSV/JSON upload
- ✅ Output: Failure type prediction (multiclass)

---

## 📊 Result

- Predicted Failure: e.g., **Power Failure**
- Confidence Level: **40%**
- Model Evaluation: ROC Curve shows excellent separation

---

## 🎯 Outcome

- Reduced unexpected downtimes
- Enabled real-time decision-making
- Cloud deployment allows easy access & predictions

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Add support for vibration, voltage, and advanced sensors
- Integrate real-time alerts for preventive maintenance
- Extend model to edge computing environments
- Experiment with deep learning (LSTM) for time-series data
